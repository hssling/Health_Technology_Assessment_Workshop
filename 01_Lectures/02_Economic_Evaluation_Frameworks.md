## Introduction to Economic Evaluation

Economic evaluation is a systematic approach to comparing the costs and consequences of alternative healthcare interventions. It provides decision-makers with evidence on how to allocate scarce healthcare resources efficiently to maximize population health benefits.

### Why Economic Evaluation Matters
- **Resource Scarcity**: Healthcare budgets are limited
- **Rising Costs**: New technologies and aging populations increase demand
- **Equity Issues**: Fair distribution of healthcare resources
- **Accountability**: Evidence-based justification for resource allocation decisions

## Types of Economic Evaluation

### 1. Cost-Minimization Analysis (CMA)
- **Use Case**: When interventions have equivalent outcomes
- **Focus**: Compare costs only (cheapest option wins)
- **Application**: Generic drugs vs branded equivalents

### 2. Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA)
- **Outcome Measure**: Natural health units (life years gained, cases cured)
- **Result**: Cost per unit of health outcome
- **Example**: Cost per malaria case prevented

### 3. Cost-Utility Analysis (CUA)
- **Outcome Measure**: Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) or disability-adjusted life years (DALYs)
- **Result**: Cost per QALY gained
- **Advantage**: Allows comparison across different disease areas

### 4. Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA)
- **Outcome Measure**: Monetary values for all consequences
- **Result**: Net monetary benefit
- **Use**: Decision-making in non-health sectors

## Fundamental Economic Concepts

### Opportunity Cost
The value of the next best alternative forgone when a decision is made.

**Key Principle**: Resources are scarce, so using them for one purpose means forgoing them for another.

### Marginal Analysis
Examines the additional (marginal) costs and benefits of small changes in resource allocation.

### Efficiency vs Equity
- **Efficiency**: Maximizing health benefits from available resources
- **Equity**: Fair distribution of health benefits across society

## Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA) Framework

### 1. Perspective
- **Health System Perspective**: Costs to healthcare provider/payer
- **Societal Perspective**: All costs regardless of who bears them
- **Patient Perspective**: Out-of-pocket costs to individuals

### 2. Time Horizon
- Short-term (trial duration)
- Medium-term (relevant clinical outcomes)
- Lifetime horizon (chronic conditions)

### 3. Discounting
Future costs and benefits are valued less than present ones due to:
- **Time Preference**: People prefer benefits now over later
- **Productivity Changes**: Future earnings may differ
- **Standard Rate**: Usually 3-5% per year

### 4. Uncertainty
- Parameter uncertainty (confidence intervals)
- Methodological uncertainty (model assumptions)
- Decision uncertainty (threshold values)

## Cost-Utility Analysis Using QALYs

### What is a QALY?
Quality-Adjusted Life Year = Life expectancy × Quality of life weight

### Quality Weights
- **Perfect Health**: 1.0
- **Dead**: 0.0
- **States worse than death**: Negative values
- **Method**: EQ-5D, SF-6D, HUI questionnaires

### Example Calculation
A treatment gives 2 additional years of life with quality weight 0.8:
- QALYs gained = 2 × 0.8 = 1.6 QALYs

## Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)

### Formula
ICER = (Cost_New - Cost_Comparator) / (Effect_New - Effect_Comparator)

### Interpretation
- **ICER < Threshold**: Cost-effective
- **ICER > Threshold**: Not cost-effective
- **ICER = Threshold**: On the boundary

### Threshold Values
- **UK (NICE)**: £20,000-£30,000 per QALY
- **WHO**: 1-3 × GDP per capita per QALY
- **India Context**: Limited explicit thresholds, often using international benchmarks

## Steps in Conducting Economic Evaluation

### 1. Define the Research Question
- Which interventions to compare?
- What perspective to take?
- What time horizon to use?

### 2. Identify Costs
- **Direct Medical Costs**: Drugs, hospitalizations, consultations
- **Direct Non-Medical Costs**: Transportation, informal care
- **Indirect Costs**: Productivity losses, time off work

### 3. Measure Outcomes
- Clinical effectiveness from RCTs/meta-analyses
- Utility values from patient surveys
- Natural units or QALYs

### 4. Analyse Costs and Outcomes
- Calculate incremental ratios
- Conduct sensitivity analysis
- Assess uncertainty

### 5. Interpret Results
- Compare against thresholds
- Consider generalizability
- Address ethical implications

## Economic Evaluation in Indian Context

### Challenges
1. **Data Limitations**: Insufficient local cost and outcome data
2. **Transferability**: Adapting foreign studies to Indian setting
3. **Context Differences**: Disease patterns, healthcare systems

### Opportunities
1. **Local Evidence**: Growing number of Indian economic evaluations
2. **Policy Relevance**: Support for Universal Health Coverage decisions
3. **Capacity Building**: Training researchers in economic evaluation methods

## Real-World Examples from Indian Context

### Example 1: HPV Vaccination
- **Intervention**: Quadrivalent HPV vaccine for adolescent girls
- **Comparator**: No vaccination
- **ICER**: ₹5,984 per QALY gained
- **Decision**: Cost-effective and included in national program

### Example 2: Rapid Diagnostic Tests for Malaria
- **Intervention**: RDTs vs clinical diagnosis in tribal areas
- **Cost Savings**: ₹8.2 million annually for Odisha state
- **Impact**: Improved case management and resource efficiency

### Example 3: Rotavirus Vaccination
- **Intervention**: Rotavirus vaccine introduction
- **Analysis**: Cost-effectiveness in Indian children under 5 years
- **Finding**: ICER of ₹1,233 per DALY averted
- **Recommendation**: Highly cost-effective intervention

### Example 4: Coronary Stent Selection
- **Interventions**: Drug-eluting stents vs bare metal stents
- **Indian Context**: Adapted costs and outcomes for local population
- **Policy Impact**: Evidence-based selection guidelines

## Sensitivity Analysis

### What is Sensitivity Analysis?
Testing how robust the results are to changes in key assumptions and parameters.

### Types
1. **One-way sensitivity analysis**: Vary one parameter at a time
2. **Multi-way sensitivity analysis**: Vary multiple parameters simultaneously
3. **Probabilistic sensitivity analysis**: Use distributions for all uncertain parameters
4. **Scenario analysis**: Test extreme scenarios

### Importance in HTA
- Demonstrates robustness of conclusions
- Identifies key drivers of results
- Helps decision-makers understand uncertainty

## Uncertainty and Decision-Making

### Sources of Uncertainty
1. **Parameter Uncertainty**: Confidence intervals around estimates
2. **Model Uncertainty**: Alternative assumptions about disease progression
3. **Methodological Uncertainty**: Choice of model structure

### Handling Uncertainty
1. **Probabilistic Analysis**: Monte Carlo simulation
2. **Value of Information**: Cost of reducing uncertainty
3. **Decision Rules**: Acceptability curves and net benefit frameworks

## Ethics in Economic Evaluation

### Key Ethical Issues
1. **Equity vs Efficiency**: Should we sacrifice some efficiency for equity?
2. **Age-Weighting**: Should healthcare prioritize younger people?
3. **Rule of Rescue**: Should we save identifiable individuals regardless of cost?
4. **Distributional Concerns**: Who benefits from healthcare spending?

### Ethical Frameworks
- **Utilitarianism**: Maximize total health benefits
- **Egalitarianism**: Equal health for all
- **Prioritarianism**: Priority to worse-off individuals

## Future Directions

### Methodological Advances
- **Machine Learning**: Prediction of costs and outcomes
- **Real-World Evidence**: Using routine healthcare data
- **Patient-Reported Outcomes**: Incorporating lived experience
- **Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis**: Beyond cost-per-QALY

### Indian Focus Areas
- **Primary Healthcare**: Economic evaluation of Ayushman Bharat
- **Digital Health**: Cost-effectiveness of telemedicine and mHealth
- **Traditional Medicine**: Integrating AYUSH with modern healthcare economics
- **Epidemic Preparedness**: Economic consequences of pandemics

## Practical Exercise

### Cost-Effectiveness Calculation
Consider two interventions for treating hypertension:

**Intervention A (Standard Care)**:
- Cost: ₹10,000 per patient
- Effectiveness: 5 QALYs gained

**Intervention B (New Drug)**:
- Cost: ₹15,000 per patient
- Effectiveness: 6 QALYs gained

**Calculate**:
1. Incremental cost = ₹15,000 - ₹10,000 = ₹5,000
2. Incremental effectiveness = 6 - 5 = 1 QALY
3. ICER = ₹5,000 ÷ 1 = ₹5,000 per QALY gained

## Summary

Economic evaluation frameworks provide the tools necessary for evidence-based healthcare decision-making. Cost-effectiveness analysis and cost-utility analysis are particularly valuable in HTA because they allow decision-makers to compare interventions across different disease areas and treatment modalities. In resource-constrained settings like India, these methods help ensure that limited healthcare budgets are used to maximize population health.

The key to successful economic evaluation lies in:
1. Clearly defining the research question and perspective
2. Accurately measuring both costs and outcomes
3. Appropriately handling uncertainty
4. Considering the local context and available resources

## Key Take-Home Points

1. Economic evaluation compares the costs and outcomes of alternative healthcare interventions.

2. Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) and cost-utility analysis (CUA) are the most commonly used types in HTA.

3. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) compares the difference in costs to the difference in outcomes between interventions.

4. QALYs (Quality-Adjusted Life Years) allow comparison of health benefits across different diseases and interventions.

5. Sensitivity analysis assesses the robustness of results to changes in key assumptions.

6. Economic evaluations must consider local context, available data, and ethical implications.

## Discussion Questions

1. How do India's unique healthcare challenges (resource constraints, diverse population, epidemiological transition) affect the application of economic evaluation methods?

2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using QALYs as a measure of health outcomes in the Indian context?

3. How should decision-makers in low- and middle-income countries like India determine appropriate cost-effectiveness thresholds?

4. In what ways might cultural values and social norms influence the interpretation of economic evaluation results?

5. How can economic evaluation support the implementation of Universal Health Coverage in India?
